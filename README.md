## Description

The analysis is for the most recent animal study data from Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, who recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and a top-level summary of the study results.

### Mouse Study Summary

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

* Prepare the data.
* Generate summary statistics.
* Total budget
* Create bar charts and pie charts.
* Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
* Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
* Calculate correlation and regression.

### Data Imports

Running the following package dependency and data imports:

* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* import pandas as pd
* import scipy.stats as st
* from scipy.stats import linregress

### Bar Charts and Pie Charts

* Create the first bar chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.
* Create the second bar chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.
* Create the first pie chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.
* Create the second pie chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.

### Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot

* Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Then, calculate the quartiles and IQR, and determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens. Use the following substeps
* Using Matplotlib, generate a box plot that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group. Highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
